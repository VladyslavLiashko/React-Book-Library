<h1> Book Library </h1>
<h2> About </h2> 

<p> In this project, I made a website where you can find and read information about any book that is in Google Books. I used Google Books api to search and display books, also using Redux I made it possible to add a book to "My collection" </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3> <b>Search Books </b> </h3>
<p>Users can search for books by keywords in the "search" field by pressing the "Enter" button. However, google books api doesn't always give the response the first time. If this happens - enter the name of the book you want to find again and press "Enter" </p>
